    <p>I am an energetic BS CS graduate from Georgia Tech seeking for a challenging entry level full-time position. I started studying computers since high school by working on projects in Java. However, I first started in Georgia Tech as an Aerospace Engineering major in 2009. But in the end I came around a long way to get back to my passion for Computer Science in 2013 after my military service. Since then, I engaged in various development projects, working with the KCS group in application development and working at PaperHost.com as a Software Engineering Co-op. Also, Participating in hackathons during the weekends always made them worthwhile. With all the fun, I wish to work at a challenging environment that I could use my full potential in a team and make impact to bigger projects.<!--You can <a href="#" target="_blank">download this free resume/CV template here</a>.
